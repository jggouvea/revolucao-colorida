# Revolução Colorida

This is an e-book in Portuguese about the current Brazilian political
situation. 

The work is done at the Markdown source `revolucao.md`. The desired 
result is found at the PDF `revolucao-colorida.pdf`, which contains
the visual results of the formatting. Information about image sizing
and paragraph formatting can be obtained from the `revoluca-colorida.odt` 
document.

Desired goals:

1. Proofreading
2. Referencing
3. Image sizing and positioning that looks good on HTML
4. Easy generation of other targets (PDF and EPUB are paramount)
5. Translation to other languages (English, Russian, Chinese and
   Spanish being the most desired ones).
